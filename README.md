## Introduction

[IP Address Finder](https://ip-searcher-eight.vercel.app) is a web app that allows you to search for an IP Address and see its location on Google Maps. It also displays the location, country, and ISP.

## Usage

When you first visit the site, it will automatically fetch your current IP Address and display its location on the map below. This tool also provides access to being able to provide detailed information of other IP addresses by entering them into the search bar.

## Purpose

I wanted to use an IP lookup API and Google Maps API to learn more about using them in applications. This tool can be useful for anyone who wishes to look up and see the location of an IP address.
